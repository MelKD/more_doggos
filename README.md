# More Doggos, Please!

A React app displaying content sourced from the Dog.api. Select dogs by breed and view of dog pics of your favourite breed - perfect if you're having a bad day!  

Because really, who doesn't love dogs!

## In progress
This is still  work in progress, and I'll be updating this with additional functions for sorting/ filtering - as well as aiming to get information about the specific breeds.
